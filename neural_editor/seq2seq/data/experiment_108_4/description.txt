Try to understand why model2.5 has worse perfomance. It happens when we add copying mechanism.
I guess that happens because ne is trained very good.
Therefore here I will lower early stopping steps for ne.

Comparison with 108 (ne early stopping rounds 25 -> 10)
108_4 vs 108:
ne
early stopped on: 51 vs 204
best val ppl: 3.24 vs 2.76 (epoch 41 vs 179)

cmg
early stopped on: 1301 vs 695
best val BLEU: 41.14 vs 40.6 (epoch 1201 vs 595)
acc (on best val BLEU): 0.241 vs 0.235
ppl (on best val BLEU): 144.59 vs 173.57

Conclusion: ne is trained almost the same, cmg is trained better, probably because of huge number of early stopping rounds (500).
