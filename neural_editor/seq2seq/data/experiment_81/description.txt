Same as 79, but bug with greedy BLEU is fixed.

Observations:
neural editor plots are good enough
BLEU and acc for cmg sharply goes up.
Cmg Duration: only 50 epochs
Model cannot generalize, val ppl doesn't go down.
TODO: inspect predictions manually, CRASHED

Conclusions: strange error happened, cannot reproduce it. also strange behaviour of bleu sharply goes up from 0 to 0.61 and simuletanusely 0 to 0.0015
