Same as 37, but edit representation size is 256, not 128

Observations: test accuracy 2.6% and train accuracy 32.3%, looks like the problem can lie in: 1. too many unk tokens and we need to copy them. 2. test data is very different from train. Further investigation is needed. For one shot learning experiment accuracy is 0 as expected.
