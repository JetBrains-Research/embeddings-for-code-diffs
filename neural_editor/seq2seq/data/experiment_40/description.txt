Should be totally same as 29 experiment. Here I want to check that if we set USE_COPYING_MECHANISM=False then we get totally the same results as we were getting before copying mechanism implementation.

Observations:
                       40                       29
best_val_perplexity: 1.2044586950175997 vs 1.2045294114504908
test acc: 0.5665809768637532 vs 0.5703513281919451
one shot learning acc: 0.09259259259259259 vs 0.09567901234567901
The biggest difference in accuracy is about 1%, so we can conclude that experiment went successfully.
