Trying to reproduce Jiang's fully.

Problem: greedy is not empty and beam search top 1 is empty... it could happen, but this probably should happen when model is under trained (our case, we test a model from first epoch), because short sequences are likely to happen (including "</s>")
Example why this can happen:
    1     2    3
<s> </s>            = 0.4
    a     b    </s> = 0.5 * 0.2 * 0.1 = 0.01


Question: why on local machine greedy accuracy and bleu is slightly different, where randomness appear?
