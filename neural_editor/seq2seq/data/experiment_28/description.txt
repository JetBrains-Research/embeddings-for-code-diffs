Same as 21, but edit representation dim 512 and leav obly changed false.

Observations: best val perplexity again is better than in 21, but 512 is too big number and overfitting occurs. Not only transfer learning experiment fails, but also generalization for other data (not from the same dataset) fails (Tufano code changes 0 50 dataset test top-50: 0.33 vs 0.38).
