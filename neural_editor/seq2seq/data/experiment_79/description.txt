Totally the same as 73, but fixed bug with beam search BLEU and also it will run on cuda and probably finish.

ERRORED EVALUATION MUST BE RUN AGAIN!

Observations:
neural editor is trained good enough based on plots
cmg model is trained badly ppl doesn't go down, accuracy can grow (is 0.003), maybe early stopping based on accuracy?
