Trying to fully reproduce Jiang.

Observations: 
accuracy grows each epoch, even if perplexity grows a lot. Strange... we should consider to run experiment where best on accuracy model will be selected.
highest BLEU is in the first epochs, then almost the same around 2.6.
One reason why perplexity on val data is very bad could be because of bad data: some data cannot be generalized correctly, therefore part of the val data is predicted completely correctly and other part completely incorrectly.
BLEU when we decode greedly is ~2.6, while when we decode via beam search ~15. WHY?
