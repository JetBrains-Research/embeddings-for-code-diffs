Same as 77 but greedy BLEU bug is fixed.

86 vs 77 (in this experiments it is Jiang reproduction with best on PPL)
Plots are very similar as expected, but BLEU is different (it is correct)

Conclusions: beam search BLEU is ~25, whereas greedy BLEU ~30. And it means that we reproduced Jiang results! Experiment results of 77 is pretty the same (77 is a little bit better) except BLEU because in 77 it was not correctly calculated.
